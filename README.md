## Thanks!

This theme took quite a bit of time to develop, and if you'd like to support my work, you can shoot me a bit of loot on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/scar45), and/or rate my extension in the [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nitrous-cloud.nitrous-vscode-color-theme). Most of all though, I hope you enjoy using this theme, and write kick-ass code while doing so. Cheers!
